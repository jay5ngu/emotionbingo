# Emotion-Bingo
The Emotion Bingo Game is an interactive activity designed to help players better understand and identify emotions by matching their definitions to corresponding emotion words. Hosted within Reddit using the Devvit framework, this game offers a visually engaging and educational experience. The game consists of a 5x5 Bingo board, where each tile contains a word representing an emotion (e.g., "Trust," "Fear," "Happiness"). At the start of the game, a random emotion's definition is displayed at the top of the screen, and the player’s goal is to locate the tile with the correct matching word on the board. The game progresses as players match definitions to words, tile by tile.

# How to Play
Players click on the words corresponding to the displayed definition. Once the user chooses the correct word, the tile is marked, and a new definition appears. The game continues until the player successfully matches words and achieves five tiles in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—triggering a winning state and displaying a celebratory message.

This game combines learning and fun, offering players an opportunity to improve their emotional literacy while engaging in a familiar Bingo format. It’s easy to play, visually intuitive, and works seamlessly within Reddit's interface for community engagement.
